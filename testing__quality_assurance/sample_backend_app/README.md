Sample back-end app
===================

A sample backend app used to illustrate testing and development techniques.

## Development operations

Most of the commands are in the Makefile

### Additional commands

Creating a migration: `poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m <message>`

## Demonstrated techniques

- integrated and external (functional / end-to-end) tests with Docker Compose
- reloading app container on code changes (`make run_reloading`)
- running tests on code changes (`make test_reloading`)
- injectable locally bound container ports - accommodating self-hosted CI runners
- autogenerated SQL migrations
- ...others...

## TODOs

- make `mypy` pass
- pytest: stop trying to interpret TestsConfig as a test class
  - https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/example/pythoncollection.html
- show coverage measurements from docker in external tests
- show that I don't normally do downgrade migrations
- external tests should wait for the API to become available to enable testing with reloads
- `make check` should also verify that requirements.txt is up to date with poetry dependencies
- why is Pylint taking so long scanning SQLAlchemy?
- make sure the use of SQLAlchemy is correct. I'm still learning it :)
- Add Github CI for the app
- app versioning
