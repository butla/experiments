Data visualisations with Pandas and Seaborn
===========================================

Look at the files to see what's here.

Run in a continuous way (edit and save main.py, and you'll get a new chart):

```
$ make run
```

You'll need https://github.com/eradman/entr, https://python-poetry.org/ and `Make` installed.
