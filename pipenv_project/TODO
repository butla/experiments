TODO: 
=====
- Run tests without any virtualenv setup - FAILED - why it doesn't automatically install everything
  from pipfile.lock? Should do sync --dev before running the command. Maybe the default operation
  (whether to install the deps, and which?)could be in the Pipfile? Or we could run without
  installing the deps by an explicit option?
  Maybe doing pipenv sync --dev and then pipenv run in a makefile isn't that horrible?
- install pytest-docker-compose from my Github URL
- write a blogpost - how I replaced my workflow with virtualenvwrapper (for prototyping)
  and tox (for "serious" project testing and development)
- check (on vagrant or lxd) if it stores the virtualenvs in ~/.virtualenvs if virtualenvwrapper
  isn't installed before installing pipenv
- removing virtualenv with a pipenv command?

Done:
=====
- setting up a project -> just pipenv install, or pipenv install with the first dependency
    This replaces virtualenvwrapper. The one added thing, though it's not big, is creating a
    directory for the project, which I didn't need to do with virtualenvwrapper. Then again,
    I only used virtualenvwrapper for experimenting, and I always needed to do the (not as effortless
    as I'd want) transition to tox when I was making the project "official". Now it's a smooth
    transition. AWESOME! So goddamn nice and simple!

Notes
=====
- the command line arguments are a bit confusing. The stuff being -- arguments seem
like commands themselves, a bit. Or am I overreacting?

- show my old work flows, contrast that with the new ones, highlight the tedious/problematic stuff
  in the old ones

- I'm not gonna reiterate anything that's in the original docs - read them
  (well, the first page, should be enough). I'm not gonna tell you how to install this (it's easy
  and it's explained there)
